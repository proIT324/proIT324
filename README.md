#### I'm a senior software engineer at heart. Solving problems has been always important to me.


I'm a highly efficient and reliable professional who possesses a broad skill set for web & mobile application development. I've been working on a range of products and clients from working on scalability problems in production to launching new applications for startups. Most of my work consists of leading small-sized teams, by creating an easy development environment, fixing technical debts, applying the best practices, and mentoring juniors.
